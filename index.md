## Title: Welcome to my first blog


> I just made a github page

hello, welcome to my blog! today in this blog i'm goona tell you how i made this blog with github pages.
I opened github and in tutorial section i found tutorail on github pages
at first i don't know what does it even mean because of the fact that i'm new here
so, i started the tutorial and learned that now i can make sites and blogs like this one that your reading currently

In the tutorial they told me to create a new reposiory which is a clone of the tutorial repository
then i was told to make changes in the _config.yml file from the my-pages branch
i added title:, description, author and ofcourse the theme: minima
then i commit, then i pull request, then boom!!! it's over!
now i'm writing my blog in a index.md file

I hope i didn't forgot any important steps and
Don't use this blog as your way to start learning github pages i'm an idiot who just started github yesterday
This blog is not a reliable source this is just for funns-ies. Thank you for reading

And sorry, i still haven't read the writing and formating basics so this blog might be a bit ugly/unactractive lookin
